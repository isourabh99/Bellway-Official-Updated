    question: "What is an MVP in software development?",
    answer:
      "An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is the initial version of a product that includes only the core features necessary to solve a specific problem and deliver value to early users. It's designed to launch quickly, validate ideas, and gather user feedback before scaling.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I build an MVP instead of a full product?",
    answer:
      "Building an MVP reduces development costs, minimizes risk, and helps validate your concept early. It allows you to launch faster, collect real user feedback, and iterate based on data rather than assumptions, ensuring a stronger product-market fit.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to develop an MVP?",
    answer:
      "The typical timeline to develop an MVP ranges from 4 to 12 weeks, depending on the complexity of the idea, the number of features, and the level of design and development required. We follow agile practices to deliver faster without compromising quality.",
  },
  {

    answer:
      "We develop MVPs for a wide range of industries including fintech, healthcare, education, logistics, SaaS, e-commerce, real estate, and more. We tailor the MVP according to your business model and target audience.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I be involved in the MVP development process?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We believe in a collaborative process. You’ll be involved in key stages like requirement gathering, design approvals, sprint reviews, and testing. Regular updates and feedback loops ensure we’re building the right product together.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer both web and mobile MVP development?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we develop MVPs for web platforms, iOS, Android, or cross-platform using technologies like React Native or Flutter. We help you choose the right tech stack based on your budget, audience, and long-term goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after the MVP is launched?",
    answer:
      "Post-launch, we help you gather user feedback, monitor performance, and identify areas of improvement. Based on analytics and user behavior, we assist in planning the next set of features and scaling your product into a full-fledged solution.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you sign NDAs for MVP projects?",
    answer:
      "Yes, protecting your idea is important to us. We’re happy to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before any discussions, ensuring your concept remains private and secure throughout the development process.",
